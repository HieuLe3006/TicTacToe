# Tic-Tac-Toe 

## Description
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O.

Any player who succeeds in placing 3 of their marks consecutively in a line (horizontal, vertical or diagonal) is the winner. 

## Method of implementation
The AI is created primarily based on `Adversarial Search` where the algorithm faces an opponent that tries to achieve the opposite goal.

The program is run on `pygame` using Python script. 

## How to run
```
python runner.py
